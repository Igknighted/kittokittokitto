=== 1.0.1 () ===
* Fixed p2nl modifier. Editing posts with the Rich Text Editor will no longer
  cause too many newline characters to be inserted, causing the formatting to
  look terrible.

* The error page for creating new threads has a 'back' button that will 
  preserve any title or message entered. This prevents you from losing your
  post text if you forgot to enter a title.

* A real permission system has been implemented. Users belong to one or more 
  staff groups, and each group has certian permisisons mapped to it. 

=== 1.0.0 (2007-09-04) ===
* Initial release.
