== 1.2.0 (2007-09-xx) ==
* Fixed a bug where Kitto would die with a fatal PHP error if the user your
  cookies belonged to does not exist.

* The hash cookie now contains a throw-away token instead of the user's real
  password hash. The token is generated using the password hash, the client's
  IP address, and a random value. Even if an attacker is able to get this hash,
  they will need to spoof the victim's IP to make it useful. These salts can
  expire, too.

* Most of the admin section has had the Spry form validations added so 
  they are consistant with the rest of the site.

* Board admin section added.

* Boards can now be set to only allow users with certain permissions to view 
  them.

* Added external_lib/PEAR.php file - this is a required external lib that is 
  'usually' fine to leave out. In some cases, a shared host may not provide the
  library.

=== 1.1.0 (2007-09-09) ===
* Fixed p2nl modifier. Editing posts with the Rich Text Editor will no longer
  cause too many newline characters to be inserted, causing the formatting to
  look terrible.

* The error page for creating new threads has a 'back' button that will 
  preserve any title or message entered. This prevents you from losing your
  post text if you forgot to enter a title.

* A real permission system has been implemented. Users belong to one or more 
  staff groups, and each group has certian permisisons mapped to it. 

* The admin panel has been (mostly) completed. Items and shop restock jobs are not done,
  but the rest of the site can be administrated. 

* Form validations using Adobe's Spry library have been added to all forms. This change adds
  visual cues and errors without the need to reload the page. Use of Spry will be expanded to
  do AJAX requests in order to perform username lookups, autosuggests, etc., in the future.

=== 1.0.0 (2007-09-04) ===
* Initial release.
